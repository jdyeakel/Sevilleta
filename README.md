**Sevilleta Foraging Model**

This program is designed to predict the foraging behaviors of both Heteromyid and Cricetid desert rodents in the SSevilleta (New Mexico), where the primary diet choices include: C3 vegetation, C3 seeds, C4 vegetation, C4 seeds, and insects.

We propose to build a stochastic dynamic program that is designed to explore diet choice (where diet consists of C3 veg./seeds, C4 veg/seeds, insects) conditioned on the energetic state, the caching behavior, and the life history of foraging rodents. These models explore which dietary behavior is expected to maximize the fitness of a forager conditional on these states. Because changes in the energetic state (and thus the fitness) of the forager is partly a function of the distribution of the potential resources across the landscape, the productivity of the landscape, which controls resource distribution, is intrinsically tied to the expected dietary behaviors of the modeled foragers. This mechanistic link will enable us to derive predictions of dietary behavior as a function of landscape productivity (read: rainfall, etc) and its inherent variability. We will compare our model predictions to field data, and use predicted dietary behaviors based on future climatic conditions (where productivity is expected to decrease and variability is expected to increase), to inform measures of vulnerability and extinction risk of different species - in particular whether there are differences in risk based on body size and/or caching behavior (btw. Heteromyids/Cricetids).
